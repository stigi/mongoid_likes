# Mongoid Likes [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/stigi/mongoid_likes.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/stigi/mongoid_likes)

mongoid_likes allows you to easily add liking ability to you Mongoid documents.


## Installation

Add the following to your Gemfile:

    gem 'mongoid_follow'

If you like living on the edge you can also add:

    gem 'mongoid_likes', :git => 'git://github.com/stigi/mongoid_likes.git', :branch => 'development'


## Requirements

This gem has been tested with [MongoID](http://mongoid.org/) version 2.4.7.


## Usage

Mongoid Likes provides two modules that you can mix in your model objects like that:

    class User
      include Mongoid::Document

      include Mongoid::Liker
    end

    class Track
      include Mongoid::Document

      include Mongoid::Likeable
    end

You can now like objects like this:

    user = User.create
    track = Track.create

    user.like(track)

You can query for likes like that:

    track.all_likers
    # => [user]

    track.likers_count
    # => 1

    user.all_likes
    # => [track]

Also likes are polymorphic, so let's assume you have a second class `Album` that is including `Mongoid::Likeable` you can do something like this:

    album = Album.create
    user.like(album)
    user.all_likes
    # => [track, album]

    user.all_likes_by_model(Album)
    # => [album]

Or even use some convenience methods:

    user.track_likes_count
    # => 1

    user.all_track_likes
    # => [track]

You get the idea. Have a look at the specs to see some more examples.


## Inspiration

Standing on the shoulders of giants:

- [mongoid_follow](https://github.com/alecguintu/mongoid_follow) by [Alec Guintu](https://github.com/alecguintu)  
    You will see that mst of my code comes from this project.
- [mongoid_votable](https://github.com/jcoene/mongoid_voteable) by [Jason Coene](https://github.com/jcoene)  
    Future versions shall aim to go in a similar direction as mongoid_votable.


## TODOs

- write a proper readme
- generate some documentation
- more tests!
- add support for [MongoMapper](http://mongomapper.com/)
